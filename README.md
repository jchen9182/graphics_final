# Graphics Final Project Justin Chen Period 10

## Implemented Features:
  - shading [wireframe/flat/gouraud/phong]
    * wireframe draws all lines which are colored black
  - mesh [constants]: filename
    * Works with triangle and quadrilateral faces
    * shading is compatible with mesh

# Bugs:
  - there are some weird lines that are shaded incorrectly for gouraud/phong
    usually near where light is reflected
